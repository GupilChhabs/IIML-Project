# Constructing the liquidity gamma index according to Pástor and Stambaugh

1) Liquidity measurement at company level

The liquidity ratio for share 𝑖 in the month 𝑡 is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator of the regression coefficient 𝛾i,t of the regression equation:

</p>

With the parameters 𝑟 i,d,t as the excess return 𝑟e, i,d,t = 𝑟 i,d,t − 𝑟 m,d,t of the realized return 𝑟 i,d,t over the value-weighted CRSP Market return 
𝑟 m,d,t at the day 𝑑 in the month t; 𝜐 i,d,t as the trading volume of the stock 𝑖 at the day 𝑑 in the month 𝑡, 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑟e, i,d,t) takes on the following values:

2) Liquidity measurement at overall market level

From the share-specific liquidity measures, in total 𝑁 each month 𝑡, the total market level is aggregated to by taking the simple average:

Adjusting the measure for inflation:

</p>

with the parameter 𝑚t, as the market value of all in the month 𝑡 in the average included stocks 𝑖 at the end of the month 𝑡 − 1 in USD and 𝑚1, as the corresponding market value in the first month of the data basis, i.e. here August 1962.

In order to calculate the changes (innovations) in the total market liquidity time series, we proceed as follows:

</p>

The computed delta △ 𝛾t is regressed on its previous value △ 𝛾t-1 and on the previous value of the scaled time series (𝑚t/𝑚1)*𝛾t-1:

</p>

These residuals, scaled by 100 𝑢t, form the time series of changes in total market liquidity (innovations in liquidity) 𝐿1:

# Interpretation of the Liquidity Gamma Index
The value of the regression coefficient 𝛾i,t can be interpreted as the cost of liquidity, t. m. as a return reversal, which accrues when USD 1 million of share 𝑖 will be traded. In terms of the overall market ratio, this is what it would cost if each share in the market traded for $1 million in transaction volume.
